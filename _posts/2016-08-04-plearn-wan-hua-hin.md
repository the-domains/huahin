  Plearn Wan is marketed as a "living museum" taking you back to a time in the
  past where you can get a feel for pre modern Thai lifestyle. Take a walk down
  memory lane to experience the look of old style Thai architecture in a setting
  akin to a bustling, old fashioned shopping area in Hua Hin or Bangkok. It is a
  very popular attraction for Thai's visiting Hua Hin as there are an abundance
  of photo opportunities and you will see imitations of old brands and popular
  food, drink and trinkets from "the good old days". One of the most interesting
  shops inside is the pharmacy, replicating traditional medicine using roots,
  powders and other concoctions.
