  Wat Huay Mongkol is a popular tourist attraction in Hua Hin and was home to
  the much lauded monk, Luang Phor Thuad. The main feature of the temple is the
  giant statue of Luang Por Thuad atop a flight of steps. Wat Huay Mongkol
  receives many Thai visitors, especially at weekends and holidays and
  surroundings are beautiful, with a large lake where you can feed fish and the
  temple itself where you can pay merit, The two carved wooden statues of
  Erawan, the 3 headed elephant are always busy with buddhist worshippers who
  believe they will receive good fortune if they walk under the elephant's legs
  and round it's head 3 times and make an offering by inserting a coin in the
  carvings. Wat Huay Mongkol is an impressive way to visit a Thai Buddhist
  Temple.
