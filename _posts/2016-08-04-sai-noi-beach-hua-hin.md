  Sai Noi Beach is a beautiful secluded beach in Khao Tao. A small fishing
  village 20 minutes away from Hua Hin. It is a fantastic place to spend a day
  away from the city. There are many beaches around the Hua Hin area but this is
  one of the best and most peaceful. The beach has a large rock face on both
  sides. There is a fantastic beach club (Sanae Beach Club) with daily
  membership available at a very cheap cost, including a shuttle service from
  Hua Hin. The beach club is great value for money and facilities include 2
  swimming pools, sun loungers, showers, lockers, changing room, bar and
  restaurant.
