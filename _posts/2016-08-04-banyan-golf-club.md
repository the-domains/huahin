  Banyan Golf Club is one of Hua Hin's best golf courses. The championship 18
  hole course was designed by Pirapon Nimatra of Golf East and opened in 2007.
  The Banyan is a par 72 golf course with a distance of 7,361 yards. The course
  was built on pineapple fields and still maintains some small pineapple
  plantations as a feature of it's past, which can make for some interesting
  shots out of the rough if you are not careful. The Banyan's signature hole is
  the 139 yards par 3, 15th, which has a stunning sea view looking over to Lion
  Island, between 2 mountains. The Banyan's clubhouse is also one of the best in
  Hua Hin, with Mulligan's pub and restaurant offering excellent food and drink
  in a setting overlooking the course towards the Burmese mountains in the
  distance.
