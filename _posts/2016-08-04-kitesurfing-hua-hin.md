  set up for it, with a 7km long beach, almost all year round wind and shallow
  water. Hua Hin also experiences little rainfall and sunshine all year round.
  There are many kiteboarding schools along the beach and the instructors are
  certified and once you finish your course, you will receive your level
  certification and become registered with the IKO (International Kitesurfing
  Organisation). The schools along the beach can accommodate all levels of
  kitesurfer, whether you just want to get a taste of it on your holiday or
  whether you are already a skilled kitesurfer. There are kitesurfing shops on
  hand if you want to buy the latest equipment or rent equipment for the
  duration of your holiday. There is also sunbeds, restaurants and cafes along
  the beach where you can relax between kiting sessions.
