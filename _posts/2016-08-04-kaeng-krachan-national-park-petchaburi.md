  Kaeng Krachan National Park is a vast area of outstanding beauty situated
  north west of Hua Hin and takes about an hour to drive there. The park runs
  along the Eastern side of the Tenasserim Mountains that provide the natural
  border between Thailand and Myanmar. The Pranburi River and Petchaburi River
  both have their sources in these mountains. Kaeng Krachan National Park has
  within it's boundaries a large reservoir, mountain range, waterfalls, caves,
  forests, fauna, flora and spectacular scenery. King Bhumibol Adulyadej assists
  in the continuing conservation of Kaeng Krachan National Park. The park is
  also home to over 400 different bird species and over 50 wild animals.
  Activities to be found at the park include taking a boat trip on the Dam which
  hosts over 30 islands, bird watching, trekking, camping, butterfly watching,
  nature trails. You can also try rafting, canoeing and tubing. The sheer size
  of the national park at over 2,900 square kilometres will give you an idea as
  to how long you want to spend there and what activities you want to take part
  in during your stay. Whether it is a full day trip or an overnight stay, you
  will not be disappointed.
