  Black Mountain Water Park is one of the most popular tourist attractions in
  Hua Hin. The 19 metre tower hosts 9 different slides to please both adults and
  children. There is also an excellent kids pool and small slides that allow the
  youngest in the family to enjoy the water park in a safe environment. The wave
  pool claims too make the biggest wave in Thailand and is super fun. There is a
  good restaurant and pool bar that provides a great point to relax between the
  attractions. Changing and locker facilities are also on site with professional
  lifeguards and staff trained in first aid ready to help if required. Black
  Mountain Water Park is truly a great, fun day out for all the family.
