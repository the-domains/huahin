  Hutsadin Elephant Foundation is a non profit organisation that was set up to
  provide care and support for elephants that had been abandoned by their owners
  due to ill health, age or because they were unable to work any longer. The aim
  of Hutsadin Elephant Foundation is to give the elephants an opportunity to
  live out their lives pain free and in an environment they are accustomed to.
  The foundation survives on donations from locals and tourists. The tourists
  can feed, walk and ride with the elephants for small donations to help pay for
  the running costs.
