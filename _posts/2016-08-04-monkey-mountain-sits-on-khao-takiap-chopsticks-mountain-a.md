  Monkey Mountain sits on Khao Takiap (Chopsticks Mountain), at the south end of
  Hua Hin beach. There is a 20 metre high Buddhist statue at the foot of the
  mountain. Wat Khao Lad Temple sits at the top of the mountain and is famous
  for the high number of monkeys that live freely around it. You get some of the
  best views of Hua Hin bay and can as far as Cha Am beach. If you walk round
  the other side of the mountain you will visit a Chinese temple with some
  decorative statues and pagodas, including a statue of Guanyin, the chinese
  goddess with 1,000 arms.
