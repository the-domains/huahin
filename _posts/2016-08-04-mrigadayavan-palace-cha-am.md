  Mrigadayavan Palace was built as a summer retreat on Bang Kra beach by King
  Rama VI in 1924. It is located in the Rama VI army camp, between Hua Hin and
  Cha Am. The Palace is built of golden teak and has 2 beautiful, covered,
  elevated walkways from the main building down to bathing pavilions on the
  beach. Mrigadayavan Palace has been fully restored after the death of King
  Rama VI and will give you a glimpse of how Thai Royalty lived in the 1920's.
  The Palace blends in superbly with the grounds it sits in and you can take a
  nature trail by foot or bicycle through the surrounding mangrove forest.
