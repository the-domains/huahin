  Royal Hua Hin Golf Course is the oldest international standard golf course in
  Thailand. It was designed by A. O. Robbins, a Scottish Railway Engineer, in
  1924. The 18 hole course plays to a par 72 over 6,678 yards. The course plays
  in the shadow of Khao Hin Lek Fai Mountain, which provides some fantastic
  views. The course plays more like a traditional Scottish Parkland course with
  tight, tree lined fairways, dog legs and elevated greens. You are likely to
  meet some Macaque monkeys on the course especially near the par 4, 13th, so
  keep an eye on your ball in case they take a fancy to it. Royal Hua Hin Golf
  Course is walking distance from the City Centre and this increases it's
  popularity due the ease of access.
