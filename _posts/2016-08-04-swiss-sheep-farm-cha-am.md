  The Swiss Sheep Farm in Cha Am is a very pleasant place to visit and has some
  great photo opportunities. We are now living in the time of the selfie after
  all... Children will love it as there is plenty of space to run around and
  play on a few mini rides. You can also feed the sheep grass and bottle feed a
  calf. There is also a restaurant on site. I would recommended you include
  visiting The Swiss Sheep Farm as part of a day trip including Camel Republic
  and the Factory Shopping Outlets as they are all close together.
