  The Eagle Milford Golf Course was opened in 1992 and plays to a par 72 over
  6,614 yards. The course was designed by Robert McFarland and is nestled
  amongst forested hills. The golf course's close proximity to the sea can bring
  stiff breezes into play and gives a links feel to it. There are some
  spectacular views on show, especially on the back 9. The key to scoring well
  on this course is keeping your ball on the tight, sloping fairways. The Eagle
  Milford has had a bit of a chequered history but it should definitely be on
  your play list and the green fees tend to be a good but cheaper than the other
  local courses.
