  Pala U Waterfall is found on the south side of Kaeng Krachan national park and
  is about 60km from Hua Hin. The waterfall has 16 stages but would take a full
  day to reach the summit. Most visitors climb to about the 5th level and there
  are enough pools and forest to walk through between the 3rd and 5th levels to
  please most people. Only the most experienced and fit walkers will reach the
  top as the journey becomes extremely difficult the higher you reach. The views
  from the top, however, are stunning. The waterfall is one of the highest in
  Thailand and the views from the top are stunning, looking over Thailand and
  towards Burma. You will likely see wildlife on your ascent, particularly
  gibbons and birds. You can access the waterfall all year round but it is
  better to avoid visiting it in wet weather.
