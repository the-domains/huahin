  Springfield Golf Course is one of Hua Hin's most established golf courses.
  Designed by Jack Nicklaus and opened in 1993, the course has 27 holes and the
  A/B combinations play to a par 72 over 7,043 yards. Springfield is one of the
  most popular golf courses in Hua Hin for membership uptake. Springfield Golf
  Course is also frequently used as a qualifying course for professionals
  competing for their Asian Tour Card. The layout of the course requires you to
  be accurate off the tee, to avoid the large bunkers and frequent water
  hazards. The course is designed to reward the good drives and punish the
  poorly placed ones. Springfield's signature par 5, 18th has an island green
  that pushes your concentration levels right to the end of your round. There
  are plenty of mature trees that line the fairways that add to the character of
  this excellent parkland golf course.
