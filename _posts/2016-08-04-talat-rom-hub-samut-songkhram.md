  Talat Rom Hub Market (Folding umbrella Market) in Samut Songkhram is an
  amazing place to visit. The market is located right alongside the railway
  tracks and you walk along the middle of the tracks between the stalls until,
  you guessed it..... the train comes! At the sound of the whistle, the
  umbrellas are pulled back and everybody scrambles off the tracks to let the
  train hurtle past.... then everything is back to normal again. You really have
  to see it to believe it. Apart from the inconvenience of the 6 times per day
  train passings, the market is a thriving place to buy fresh fish, fruit,
  vegetables and spices. If you like markets, you will love Talat Rom Hub
  Market. The local speciality is Thai Mackerel. As well as the fresh produce on
  sale, you can buy freshly cooked Thai food and snacks. If you are taking a day
  trip from Hua Hin, it is suggested to go to Damnoen Saduak Floating market in
  Ratchaburi in the morning and Talat Rom Hub Market in Samut Songkhram in the
  afternoon.
