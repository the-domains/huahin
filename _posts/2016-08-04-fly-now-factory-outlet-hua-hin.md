  Fly Now Factory Outlet is a leading shopping destination located between Hua
  Hin and Cha Am, opposite The Sheraton Hotel. You can find many good bargains
  here from brand names like adidas, diesel, ralph lauren, zara, polo and calvin
  klein. You can also buy bedding, furniture, luggage, kitchenware and homewear
  as well as clothing. There is also a pizza restaurant and coffee shop on site.
  Hua Hin now offers a great selection of malls and outlets for shoppers to
  loosen their purse strings. It would be a good idea to include visiting the
  Fly Now Factory Outlet with the Premium Factory Outlet in Cha Am, Camel
  Republic and the Swiss Sheep Farm to make a full day out.
