  Black Mountain Golf Course is voted the best golf course in Hua Hin by many.
  The championship 18 hole golf course was designed by Phil Ryan of Pacific
  Coast Design and rebuilt by Notlov & Edfors. The course opened in 2007 and has
  hosted Asian Tour events including The Kings Cup and the True Thailand
  Classic, which was a co-sanctioned Asian Tour and European Tour event. Black
  Mountain became the first golf course in Asia to become a member of "European
  Tour Properties". The par 72, 7,420 yards course uses native red grass and
  provides a great test for golfers to decide on what best strategy to use on
  your approach shots to balance risk and reward. Black Mountain also has
  excellent practice facilities to allow you to tone your driving skills and
  work on your short game. Black Mountain is a favourite amongst tour
  professionals who frequently use the facilities to train under actual playing
  conditions. The clubhouse at Black Mountain is also the best in the area, with
  exceptional food in a glorious setting.
