  Kui Buri National Park has a high number of wild elephants and you are almost
  guaranteed to see some of them due to the numerous open areas that are easily
  accessed. Kui Buri National Park is also home to other wild animals and birds
  such as gaurs, deer, bantengs, langurs, tigers, leopards, black bears, asian
  open bill, indian roller and crested fireback. The facilities within the park
  are a little wanting with no restaurant but there is a campsite with basic
  facilities there. The park has a good mixture of forested areas with open
  plains that allow the safari trips on offer to produce a high success rate in
  seeing the wildlife. Kui Buri National Park is also home to 4 waterfalls,
  including Huay Dong Mai Fai waterfall and Pha Ma Hon waterfall. The park
  promotes an eco friendly approach and uses local farmers as safari guides,
  relying on their local knowledge and keen interest in preserving the national
  park. It will take about one and a half hours to drive to Kui Buri National
  Park from Hua Hin.
