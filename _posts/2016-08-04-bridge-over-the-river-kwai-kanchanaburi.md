  The Bridge Over The River Kwai, in Kanchanaburi is an excellent option for a
  day trip from Hua Hin. Kanchanaburi is 211 km from Hua Hin and takes about 2.5
  to 3 hours to drive there. The Bridge over the River Kwai is one of Thailand's
  most popular tourist attractions. The bridge was a strategic supply route
  during World War II, to get supplies from Thailand to Burma on what has been
  called "Death Railway". An estimated 80,000 people were killed during the
  construction of the railway. About 20 minutes further down the track is
  "hellfire pass" which has now been turned into a memorial walk with a museum.
  The Kanchanaburi War Cemetery is another area to visit and has many visitors
  throughout the year, especially on ANZAC day. If you want to extend your stay
  overnight in a guesthouse in Kanchanaburi, there is a chilled out bar scene
  near the riverside and you can visit of the area's magnificent waterfalls the
  following day, before returning to Hua Hin.
