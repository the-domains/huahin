  Palm Hills Golf Course is located just off the main road between Hua Hin and
  Cha Am and is set on undulating terrain between two lakes. The course was
  designed by Max Wexler in 1992 and plays to a par 72 over 6,892 yards. The
  wider, bluegrass fairways can be somewhat forgiving but you still need to
  negotiate your way carefully past the bunkers and water hazards. The Tiff
  Eagle greens are super fast and can ruin a good scorecard but it is all part
  of the challenge. The palm trees and shrubbery add to the courses natural
  beauty and there are some stunning residential homes along the outskirts of
  the golf course. The back 9 has some stunning views over the gulf of Thailand
  from its elevated position. Palm Hills golf club also has practice areas, a
  clubhouse, and sports club with sauna and swimming pool, fitness centre,
  indoor badminton court, tennis courts, squash courts snooker room and table
  tennis.
