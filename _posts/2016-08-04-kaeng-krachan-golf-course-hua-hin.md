  Kaeng Krachan Golf Course is part of the Kaeng Krachan Estate and is one of a
  few golf remote courses in the Hua Hin area. It is only 40km from Hua Hin so
  you can still get there easily within an hour. There are 27 holes to play. The
  first 18 were designed by Cherd Boonyaratavej and the additional 9 holes were
  designed by Jack Nicklaus. The yardage of the original 18 holes is 6,427
  playing to a par of 72 and opened in 1990. The course is surrounded by
  mountains, forests and lakes and there are many water hazards to contend with.
  You need to be fairly accurate off the tee and try to keep on the fairways as
  the rough can be quite unforgiving. Jack Nicklaus's design team did a
  fantastic job of incorporating the natural beauty of the area into a
  challenging course for all levels of golfer. Facilities at the course include
  a clubhouse, pro shop, restaurant, driving range, putting green and
  accommodation.
