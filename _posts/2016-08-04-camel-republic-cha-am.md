  Camel Republic is like a mini zoo with camels, alpaca, flamingoes, angora
  goats, giraffes, patagonian mara, swans, mandarin ducks, wood ducks, mallard
  ducks, koi carp, macaws, african grey parrots, chattering lory, duyvenbode
  lory, budgies, sun conures, love birds, goudian finches, zebra finches, and
  forpus. There are also a couple of amusement rides and shops and restaurants
  to enjoy. Camel Republic is a great attraction to combine with seeing the
  Swiss Sheep Farm and the Factory Shopping Outlets as they are all near each
  other and would fill a full day to please every member of the family or group.
