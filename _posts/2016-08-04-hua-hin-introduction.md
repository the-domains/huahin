  Hua Hin is quite simply the best place to live, retire to, holiday in and golf
  in Thailand. It has a little taste of everything and has the right balance of
  Thai and Western influences and acceptance. The cost of living in Hua Hin is
  also a big draw to retirees looking to properly enjoy their retirement. You
  can live a very good lifestyle here at a fraction of the cost in the west. Hua
  Hin became famous as a traditional Thai seaside resort after various members
  of the Thai Royal Family began to build summer retreats and palaces in the
  area. Then, in the 1920's, The Railway Hotel, the railway line from Bangkok to
  Hua Hin and The Royal Hua Hin Golf Course were built. Hua Hin has more
  recently (in the last 20 years) grown into a modern, vibrant city, with good
  facilities and amenities. It is a haven for foreign tourism and now boasts
  around 3,000 full time foreign residents and high tourist numbers between
  October and April each year. The rise in tourism has seen the infrastructure
  grow to provide the facilities any modern city needs. Hua Hin is being
  promoted as the future of Thai Tourism and is very much focused on being a
  family friendly destination that is also ideal for retirees. Hua Hin is a safe
  city and you very rarely see any trouble. There is an abundance of shopping
  malls and markets that cater for all budgets and tastes and provide pleasant,
  air conditioned escapes from the heat. Hua Hin's weather remains around 28 to
  32 degrees all year and the area has the least amount of rainfall in Thailand.
  There are 9 top class golf courses in the area and Black Mountain and The
  Banyan have helped cement Hua Hin into one of the world's best golfing
  destinations. The courses are well managed and you can play all year round.
  Thailand has a fantastic road network and Hua Hin is only 230 km from Bangkok
  and the islands in the south are easily accessible by motorway and ferry.
  There are also plans in place for a high speed rail network connecting Bangkok
  to Hua Hin, a ferry service connecting Hua Hin to both Bangkok and Pattaya and
  an expansion of Hua Hin airport to cater for international flights. The layout
  of Hua Hin consists of the beach to the east of the railway track and vast
  areas of land with stunning mountain views to the west of the railway track.
  The beach side of the railway track has hotels and condos taking pride of
  place along the full coastline and also hosts downtown Hua Hin, where you can
  find most of the hotels, guesthouses, popular bars, restaurants and night
  markets. The west side of the railway track has grown incredibly quickly over
  the last 10 years and there are now many housing developments which have
  become villages with the infrastructure to support them. Soi 112 is becoming
  "New Town" Hua Hin and is aided by a new road linking the south side of town
  to the bypass connecting Bangkok to the south of Thailand. You will never
  visit Hua Hin once as it's magic and charm will always bring you back again.
