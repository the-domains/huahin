  Vana Nava Water Park is the first jungle water park in Asia. Vana Nava is eco
  friendly and uses state of the art technology in its 19 rides. The rides
  include "The Abyss", which is Thailand's biggest water slide standing at 28
  metres. Other exciting slides include Boomerango, Lazy River, Vana Nava Falls,
  Kiddie Cove, Aqua Loop, The Surf Zone and an "on water" Obstacle Course. There
  is also an underwater photo studio (another first for Thailand). There are
  plenty of sheltered areas where you can relax eat, drink and have a massage.
  Vana Nava is a must visit attraction when you are Hua Hin.
