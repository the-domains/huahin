  Sea Pines Golf Course is the newest addition to Hua Hin's fantastic selection
  of golf courses. Opened in 2010 and designed by Major General Weerayudth
  Phetbuasak, Sea Pines plays to a par 72 over 7,305 yards. The uniqueness of
  The Sea Pines Golf Course is down to 6 of the holes playing alongside the
  beach, giving a links style feel. Sea Pines was established for the Thai Army
  and it should be noted that priority will be given to Army Officers so it is
  best to check how busy the playing field is before booking your tee time. The
  course itself presents a good challenge to golfers, particularly in windy
  conditions. The signature hole is the par 3, 17th, which requires a long carry
  over water to the bunker guarded green. If you are visiting Hua Hin to play
  golf, you must include Sea Pines in your play list.
