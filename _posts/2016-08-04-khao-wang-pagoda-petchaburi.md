  Khao Wang Pagoda in Phetchaburi was commissioned by King Rama IV and completed
  in 1858. The summer palace is spread over 3 hilltops and was previously used
  to host and entertain special guests of the Royalty. The palace can be seen as
  you pass Petchaburi on the main motorway from Bangkok to Hua Hin but is more
  impressive if you take the time to take a closer look. The buildings comprise
  a mix of Thai, Chinese and European architecture and offer panoramic views
  across Petchaburi. The mix of buildings include a similar temple to the Temple
  of the Emerald Buddha, in Bangkok, an observatory that was used by the keen
  astronomer, King Rama IV and the 40 metres high Phra That Chom Phet. Khao Wang
  Pagoda is a very popular attraction for both local and foreign visitors due
  its links with Thai Royalty.
