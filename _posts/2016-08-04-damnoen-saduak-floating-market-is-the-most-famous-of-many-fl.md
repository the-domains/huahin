  Damnoen Saduak Floating Market is the most famous of many floating markets in
  Thailand. Countless vendors paddle up and down the congested canals, selling
  fresh fruit and vegetables. It is an experience not to be missed when visiting
  Thailand and you will soon be caught up in the buzz created by buyers and
  merchants bargaining for the produce. The best time to visit is early morning
  as it is cooler and that is when the market is at it's busiest. There is
  plenty opportunities to try and buy traditional Thai food and snacks canal
  side. The whole experience will remain with you for a long time as there so
  many colours on show, so much activity and a great insight into bygone days in
  Thailand. If you are taking a day trip from Hua Hin, it is suggested to go to
  Damnoen Saduak Floating market in Ratchaburi in the morning and Talat Rom Hub
  Market in Samut Songkhram in the afternoon.
