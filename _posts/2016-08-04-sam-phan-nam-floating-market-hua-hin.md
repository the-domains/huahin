  Sam Phan Nam Floating Market is a short drive away from the city centre,
  about. You turn left about 3/4 of the way along the up and coming Soi 112,
  heading towards the bypass and it is on your right hand side, a few hundred
  metres from the turning. There are almost 200 shops selling everything from
  clothes, souvenirs and food. It is built around a man made lake and most of
  the shops are built on a boardwalk that makes for a very pleasant stroll.
  There are also shops on boats that float alongside the boardwalk. There are
  numerous photo opportunities and there is a miniature railway that you can
  ride around the perimeter of the market. It is more of a tourist attraction
  than a traditional floating market that would sell fresh produce. The
  experience will give you a good idea of what a floating market is, without
  having to make the full day trip. Sam Phan Nam Floating Market also has a
  floating exhibition area in the middle of the lake that hosts traditional
  dance, music and theatre. All in all it is a very pleasant way to spend a
  morning or afternoon.
