  Phraya Nakhon Cave is one of Hua Hin's most photographed attractions. It is
  situated in the Sam Roi Yot (300 peaks) national park and can be accessed by
  longtail boat trip from beach or you can choose to walk around a pretty steep,
  rocky path to the foot of the climb. The walking path from the beach at the
  foot of the hill to the summit takes you through forested hillside and has a
  viewpoint half way up to allow you take in the views of the gulf of Thailand
  and some small islands that sit up nearby. Once you reach the top, you begin
  your walk down into the cave where you will see the enchanting Kuha Karuhas
  Pavilion. The best time to view it is between 10.30 and 11.30 in the morning
  as that is when the best lighting effects enter the cave through the open
  hilltop. Phraya Nakhon Cave is famed in Thailand as three of the revered Thai
  kings have visited it and King Rama IV and King Rama VII have signed the wall
  to the right of the Kuha Karuhas Pavilion.
