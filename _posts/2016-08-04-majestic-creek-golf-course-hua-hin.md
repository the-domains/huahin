  Majestic Creek Golf Course is one of Hua Hin's best laid out golf courses. The
  challenges presented to golfers include long water carries over lakes and
  water hazards. There are many well positioned bunkers to make you think long
  and hard about your drives and approach shots. Majestic creek was designed by
  Dr Sukkitti Klangvisai and has 27 holes. The 7,123 yards layout plays to a par
  72 with the additional 9 holes to a par 36. Extensive renovations have been
  made to the course and clubhouse since 2012 and has become one the best kept
  and best value courses in the area. The waterfall provides a conversion piece
  for the signature par 3, 5th hole and the palm trees lining the fairways help
  make this one of the most stunning golf courses around.
