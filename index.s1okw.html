</picture><p>Hua Hin is quite simply the best place to live, retire to, holiday in and golf in Thailand. It has a little taste of everything and has the right balance of Thai and Western influences and acceptance. The cost of living in Hua Hin is also a big draw to
    retirees looking to properly enjoy their retirement. You can live a very good lifestyle here at a fraction of the cost in the west. Hua Hin became famous as a traditional Thai seaside resort after various members of the Thai Royal Family began to
    build summer retreats and palaces in the area. Then, in the 1920's, The Railway Hotel, the railway line from Bangkok to Hua Hin and The Royal Hua Hin Golf Course were built. Hua Hin has more recently (in the last 20 years) grown into a modern, vibrant
    city, with good facilities and amenities. It is a haven for foreign tourism and now boasts around 3,000 full time foreign residents and high tourist numbers between October and April each year. The rise in tourism has seen the infrastructure grow
    to provide the facilities any modern city needs. Hua Hin is being promoted as the future of Thai Tourism and is very much focused on being a family friendly destination that is also ideal for retirees. Hua Hin is a safe city and you very rarely see
    any trouble. There is an abundance of shopping malls and markets that cater for all budgets and tastes and provide pleasant, air conditioned escapes from the heat. The range of restaurants and eateries in Hua Hin is nothing short of magnificent. You
    are spoilt for choice in quality, quantity variety and affordability. You should find it easy to find a restaurant that offers food from almost any part of the world. Hua Hin's weather remains around 28 to 32 degrees all year and the area has the
    least amount of rainfall in Thailand. There are 9 top class golf courses in the area and Black Mountain and The Banyan have helped cement Hua Hin into one of the world's best golfing destinations. The courses are well managed and you can play all
    year round. Thailand has a fantastic road network and Hua Hin is only 230 km from Bangkok and the islands in the south are easily accessible by motorway and ferry. There are also plans in place for a high speed rail network connecting Bangkok to Hua
    Hin, a ferry service connecting Hua Hin to both Bangkok and Pattaya and an expansion of Hua Hin airport to cater for international flights. The layout of Hua Hin consists of the beach to the east of the railway track and vast areas of land with stunning
    mountain views to the west of the railway track. The beach side of the railway track has hotels and condos taking pride of place along the full coastline and also hosts downtown Hua Hin, where you can find most of the hotels, guesthouses, popular
    bars, restaurants and night markets. The west side of the railway track has grown incredibly quickly over the last 10 years and there are now many housing developments which have become villages with the infrastructure to support them. Soi 112 is
    becoming "New Town" Hua Hin and is aided by a new road linking the south side of town to the bypass connecting Bangkok to the south of Thailand. You will never visit Hua Hin once as it's magic and charm will always bring you back again.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="12"><!-- react-empty: 13 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-62542625-8110-40cc-a279-a377a81e10d7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="16"><a class=" " href="sai-noi-beach-hua-hin" data-reactid="17"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="18"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="19"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f0e32d33a2ec143d60ce7632821db680/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe12db2e2-84ba-44fb-891c-18009993acf8.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:50.069348127600556% 70.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="20"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f0e32d33a2ec143d60ce7632821db680/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe12db2e2-84ba-44fb-891c-18009993acf8.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:50.069348127600556% 70.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="21"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b40321bf9c383af56de25159f51adc92/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe12db2e2-84ba-44fb-891c-18009993acf8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50.069348127600556% 70.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/193db37118e3bbf9c2e672eb3cfc0c3e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe12db2e2-84ba-44fb-891c-18009993acf8.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.069348127600556% 70.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="23"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="721" data-height="480" data-ratio="1.5020833333333334" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f0e32d33a2ec143d60ce7632821db680/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe12db2e2-84ba-44fb-891c-18009993acf8.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:50.069348127600556% 70.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="24"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="25"><!-- react-empty: 26 --><!-- react-empty: 27 --><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="31"><p>Sai Noi Beach is a beautiful secluded beach in Khao Tao.

</picture><p>Kaeng Krachan National Park is a vast area of outstanding beauty situated north west of Hua Hin and takes about an hour to drive there. The park runs along the Eastern side of the Tenasserim Mountains that provide the natural border between Thailand and
    Myanmar. The Pranburi River and Petchaburi River both have their sources in these mountains. Kaeng Krachan National Park has within it's boundaries a large reservoir, mountain range, waterfalls, caves, forests, fauna, flora and spectacular scenery.
    King Bhumibol Adulyadej assists in the continuing conservation of Kaeng Krachan National Park. The park is also home to over 400 different bird species and over 50 wild animals. Activities to be found at the park include taking a boat trip on the

The summer palace is spread over 3 hilltops and was previously used to host and entertain special guests of the Royalty. The palace can be seen as you pass Petchaburi on the main motorway from Bangkok to Hua Hin but is more impressive if you take the time to take a closer look. The buildings comprise a mix of Thai, Chinese and European architecture and offer panoramic views across Petchaburi. The mix of buildings include a similar temple to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in Bangkok, an observatory that was used by the keen astronomer, King Rama IV and the 40 metres high Phra That Chom Phet. Khao Wang Pagoda is a very popular attraction for both local and foreign visitors due its links with Thai Royalty.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-7af765ae-ba76-48fe-bce3-43a18d0e0cb1" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="107"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="108"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="109"><a class=" " href="premium-outlet-cha-am-is-factory-outlet-shopping-mall-betwee" data-reactid="110"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="111"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="112"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/523a87d9d7022bb1d94d7a47970bd8f7/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb96e4ab1-f031-4386-a142-87f36e5cec27.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:38.21081830790568% 28.125%;" data-reactid="113"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/523a87d9d7022bb1d94d7a47970bd8f7/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb96e4ab1-f031-4386-a142-87f36e5cec27.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:38.21081830790568% 28.125%;" data-reactid="114"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5e7fd30ac573eb2ffb10515978b56da8/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb96e4ab1-f031-4386-a142-87f36e5cec27.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:38.21081830790568% 28.125%;" data-reactid="115"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bb438babf3fcb997def5aa75e9b09321/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb96e4ab1-f031-4386-a142-87f36e5cec27.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:38.21081830790568% 28.125%;" data-reactid="116"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="721" data-height="480" data-ratio="1.5020833333333334" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/523a87d9d7022bb1d94d7a47970bd8f7/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fb96e4ab1-f031-4386-a142-87f36e5cec27.jpg&amp;width=721" style="object-position:38.21081830790568% 28.125%;" data-reactid="117"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="118"><!-- react-empty: 119 --><!-- react-empty: 120 --><!-- react-empty: 121 --><!-- react-empty: 122 --><!-- react-empty: 123 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="124"><p>Premium Outlet Cha Am is factory outlet shopping mall between Cha Am and Petchaburi.

If you are taking a day trip from Hua Hin, it is suggested to go to Damnoen Saduak Floating market in Ratchaburi in the morning and Talat Rom Hub Market in Samut Songkhram in the afternoon.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="143"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="144"><a class=" " href="tham-khao-luang-cave-phetchaburi" data-reactid="145"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="146"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="147"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f9a3d10200d2e99c8638ac131030a7e0/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79f70a34-071c-4c61-8f26-de96d8480162.jpg&amp;width=785" style="object-position:73.43949044585986% 21.145833333333332%;" data-reactid="148"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f9a3d10200d2e99c8638ac131030a7e0/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79f70a34-071c-4c61-8f26-de96d8480162.jpg&amp;width=785" style="object-position:73.43949044585986% 21.145833333333332%;" data-reactid="149"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/08e450316b03d3ab5ce6e3b88bdf8cf3/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79f70a34-071c-4c61-8f26-de96d8480162.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:73.43949044585986% 21.145833333333332%;" data-reactid="150"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c251e283de2d5281e90409a9ca0d079e/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79f70a34-071c-4c61-8f26-de96d8480162.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:73.43949044585986% 21.145833333333332%;" data-reactid="151"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="785" data-height="480" data-ratio="1.6354166666666667" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f9a3d10200d2e99c8638ac131030a7e0/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79f70a34-071c-4c61-8f26-de96d8480162.jpg&amp;width=785" style="object-position:73.43949044585986% 21.145833333333332%;" data-reactid="152"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="153"><!-- react-empty: 154 --><!-- react-empty: 155 --><!-- react-empty: 156 --><!-- react-empty: 157 --><!-- react-empty: 158 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="159"><p>Tham Khao Luang Cave is an impressive, open top, limestone cave situated about 5km outside Phetchaburi.

The market is located right alongside the railway tracks and you walk along the middle of the tracks between the stalls until, you guessed it..... the train comes! At the sound of the whistle, the umbrellas are pulled back and everybody scrambles off the tracks to let the train hurtle past.... then everything is back to normal again. You really have to see it to believe it. Apart from the inconvenience of the 6 times per day train passings, the market is a thriving place to buy fresh fish, fruit, vegetables and spices. If you like markets, you will love Talat Rom Hub Market. The local speciality is Thai Mackerel. As well as the fresh produce on sale, you can buy freshly cooked Thai food and snacks. If you are taking a day trip from Hua Hin, it is suggested to go to Damnoen Saduak Floating market in Ratchaburi in the morning and Talat Rom Hub Market in Samut Songkhram in the afternoon.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="196"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="197"><a class=" " href="black-mountain-golf-course-hua-hin" data-reactid="198"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="199"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="200"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/867a4a40f1563bb39e476e37bb3b21d6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2cb1f049-b809-4fa3-82b2-7c18a2742913.jpg&amp;width=782" style="object-position:50.06393861892583% 50.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="201"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/867a4a40f1563bb39e476e37bb3b21d6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2cb1f049-b809-4fa3-82b2-7c18a2742913.jpg&amp;width=782" style="object-position:50.06393861892583% 50.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="202"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2d28765f01fad68c042403b3b0a1eddb/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2cb1f049-b809-4fa3-82b2-7c18a2742913.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:50.06393861892583% 50.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="203"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aabddd2e6d21ea960e0423a2e42ae65a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2cb1f049-b809-4fa3-82b2-7c18a2742913.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.06393861892583% 50.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="204"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="782" data-height="480" data-ratio="1.6291666666666667" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/867a4a40f1563bb39e476e37bb3b21d6/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2cb1f049-b809-4fa3-82b2-7c18a2742913.jpg&amp;width=782" style="object-position:50.06393861892583% 50.10416666666667%;" data-reactid="205"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="206"><!-- react-empty: 207 --><!-- react-empty: 208 --><!-- react-empty: 209 --><!-- react-empty: 210 --><!-- react-empty: 211 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="212"><p>Black Mountain Golf Course is voted the best golf course in Hua Hin by many.

Black Mountain Water Park is truly a great, fun day out for all the family.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="231"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="232"><a class=" " href="black-mountain-wake-park-hua-hin" data-reactid="233"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="234"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="235"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8d21bd49d16e092e95313d4a8f232ed6/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85e6ba6a-0d50-42e9-b37b-33715cc67827.jpg&amp;width=679" style="object-position:74.22680412371135% 65.9375%;" data-reactid="236"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8d21bd49d16e092e95313d4a8f232ed6/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85e6ba6a-0d50-42e9-b37b-33715cc67827.jpg&amp;width=679" style="object-position:74.22680412371135% 65.9375%;" data-reactid="237"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8d21bd49d16e092e95313d4a8f232ed6/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85e6ba6a-0d50-42e9-b37b-33715cc67827.jpg&amp;width=679" style="object-position:74.22680412371135% 65.9375%;" data-reactid="238"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/90d768dbaf9b6498f2ba84bc199b923c/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85e6ba6a-0d50-42e9-b37b-33715cc67827.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:74.22680412371135% 65.9375%;" data-reactid="239"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="679" data-height="480" data-ratio="1.4145833333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8d21bd49d16e092e95313d4a8f232ed6/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85e6ba6a-0d50-42e9-b37b-33715cc67827.jpg&amp;width=679" style="object-position:74.22680412371135% 65.9375%;" data-reactid="240"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="241"><!-- react-empty: 242 --><!-- react-empty: 243 --><!-- react-empty: 244 --><!-- react-empty: 245 --><!-- react-empty: 246 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="247"><p>Black Mountain Wake Park is a fantastic way to get an adrenalin rush.

It has a little taste of everything and has the right balance of Thai and Western influences and acceptance. The cost of living in Hua Hin is also a big draw to retirees looking to properly enjoy their retirement. You can live a very good lifestyle here at a fraction of the cost in the west. Hua Hin became famous as a traditional Thai seaside resort after various members of the Thai Royal Family began to build summer retreats and palaces in the area. Then, in the 1920's, The Railway Hotel, the railway line from Bangkok to Hua Hin and The Royal Hua Hin Golf Course were built. Hua Hin has more recently (in the last 20 years) grown into a modern, vibrant city, with good facilities and amenities. It is a haven for foreign tourism and now boasts around 3,000 full time foreign residents and high tourist numbers between October and April each year. The rise in tourism has seen the infrastructure grow to provide the facilities any modern city needs. Hua Hin is being promoted as the future of Thai Tourism and is very much focused on being a family friendly destination that is also ideal for retirees. Hua Hin is a safe city and you very rarely see any trouble. There is an abundance of shopping malls and markets that cater for all budgets and tastes and provide pleasant, air conditioned escapes from the heat. The range of restaurants and eateries in Hua Hin is nothing short of magnificent. You are spoilt for choice in quality, quantity variety and affordability. You should find it easy to find a restaurant that offers food from almost any part of the world. Hua Hin's weather remains around 28 to 32 degrees all year and the area has the least amount of rainfall in Thailand. There are 9 top class golf courses in the area and Black Mountain and The Banyan have helped cement Hua Hin into one of the world's best golfing destinations. The courses are well managed and you can play all year round. Thailand has a fantastic road network and Hua Hin is only 230 km from Bangkok and the islands in the south are easily accessible by motorway and ferry. There are also plans in place for a high speed rail network connecting Bangkok to Hua Hin, a ferry service connecting Hua Hin to both Bangkok and Pattaya and an expansion of Hua Hin airport to cater for international flights. The layout of Hua Hin consists of the beach to the east of the railway track and vast areas of land with stunning mountain views to the west of the railway track. The beach side of the railway track has hotels and condos taking pride of place along the full coastline and also hosts downtown Hua Hin, where you can find most of the hotels, guesthouses, popular bars, restaurants and night markets. The west side of the railway track has grown incredibly quickly over the last 10 years and there are now many housing developments which have become villages with the infrastructure to support them. Soi 112 is becoming \"New Town\" Hua Hin and is aided by a new road linking the south side of town to the bypass connecting Bangkok to the south of Thailand. You will never visit Hua Hin once as it's magic and charm will always bring you back again.","keywords":[],"via":{}},"content":[{"id":"3437bab9-07bf-49f9-8040-d543bce98173","item":"ec9b17c1-01a9-4c1c-9aaf-fc1fe9b25b24","type":"image","created_at":"2016-08-04T06:48:49.325Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T16:22:02.394Z","_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b684bb82bff35776c0c5ad1398f93639/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg","inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg","resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/504ec2a20a6abfaaad26fef3c943f429.png","ratio":"7:4","aspect":1.75,"orientation":"landscape","width":700,"height":400,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0ab30ee1f59d8a4174010af906792fe9/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=700"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b684bb82bff35776c0c5ad1398f93639/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F249f6eed-8912-4318-96ee-9aa0fe3072ce.jpg&width=360"}],"faces":[{"x":95,"y":95,"width":38,"height":38,"confidence":5.000737}],"colors":[[1,147,194],[255,255,253],[149,138,110],[206,202,177],[208,0,0]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[100,59],[294,347]],"confidence":0.475556,"center":[191,208],"radius":159.451},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"6d6fa10d-2410-464d-b92d-73e995f9b5ea","item":"ec9b17c1-01a9-4c1c-9aaf-fc1fe9b25b24","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-04T06:00:18.706Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T16:22:02.394Z","_text":"Hua Hin is quite simply the best place to live, retire to, holiday in and golf in Thailand.

The market is located right alongside the railway tracks and you walk along the middle of the tracks between the stalls until, you guessed it..... the train comes! At the sound of the whistle, the umbrellas are pulled back and everybody scrambles off the tracks to let the train hurtle past.... then everything is back to normal again.
