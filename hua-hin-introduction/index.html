<p>Hua Hin is quite simply the best place to live, retire to, holiday in and golf in Thailand. It has a little taste of everything and has the right balance of Thai and Western influences and acceptance. The cost of living in Hua Hin is also a big draw to retirees looking to properly enjoy their retirement. You can live a very good lifestyle here at a fraction of the cost in the west. Hua Hin became famous as a traditional Thai seaside resort after various members of the Thai Royal Family began to build summer retreats and palaces in the area. Then, in the 1920's, The Railway Hotel, the railway line from Bangkok to Hua Hin and The Royal Hua Hin Golf Course were built. Hua Hin has more recently (in the last 20 years) grown into a modern, vibrant city, with good facilities and amenities. It is a haven for foreign tourism and now boasts around 3,000 full time foreign residents and high tourist numbers between October and April each year. The rise in tourism has seen the infrastructure grow to provide the facilities any modern city needs. Hua Hin is being promoted as the future of Thai Tourism and is very much focused on being a family friendly destination that is also ideal for retirees. Hua Hin is a safe city and you very rarely see any trouble. There is an abundance of shopping malls and markets that cater for all budgets and tastes and provide pleasant, air conditioned escapes from the heat. The range of restaurants and eateries in Hua Hin is nothing short of magnificent. You are spoilt for choice in quality, quantity variety and affordability. You should find it easy to find a restaurant that offers food from almost any part of the world. Hua Hin's weather remains around 28 to 32 degrees all year and the area has the least amount of rainfall in Thailand. There are 9 top class golf courses in the area and Black Mountain and The Banyan have helped cement Hua Hin into one of the world's best golfing destinations. The courses are well managed and you can play all year round. Thailand has a fantastic road network and Hua Hin is only 230 km from Bangkok and the islands in the south are easily accessible by motorway and ferry. There are also plans in place for a high speed rail network connecting Bangkok to Hua Hin, a ferry service connecting Hua Hin to both Bangkok and Pattaya and an expansion of Hua Hin airport to cater for international flights. The layout of Hua Hin consists of the beach to the east of the railway track and vast areas of land with stunning mountain views to the west of the railway track. The beach side of the railway track has hotels and condos taking pride of place along the full coastline and also hosts downtown Hua Hin, where you can find most of the hotels, guesthouses, popular bars, restaurants and night markets. The west side of the railway track has grown incredibly quickly over the last 10 years and there are now many housing developments which have become villages with the infrastructure to support them. Soi 112 is becoming "New Town" Hua Hin and is aided by a new road linking the south side of town to the bypass connecting Bangkok to the south of Thailand. You will never visit Hua Hin once as it's magic and charm will always bring you back again.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">huahin</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>

The courses are well managed and you can play all year round. Thailand has a fantastic road network and Hua Hin is only 230 km from Bangkok and the islands in the south are easily accessible by motorway and ferry. There are also plans in place for a high speed rail network connecting Bangkok to Hua Hin, a ferry service connecting Hua Hin to both Bangkok and Pattaya and an expansion of Hua Hin airport to cater for international flights. The layout of Hua Hin consists of the beach to the east of the railway track and vast areas of land with stunning mountain views to the west of the railway track. The beach side of the railway track has hotels and condos taking pride of place along the full coastline and also hosts downtown Hua Hin, where you can find most of the hotels, guesthouses, popular bars, restaurants and night markets. The west side of the railway track has grown incredibly quickly over the last 10 years and there are now many housing developments which have become villages with the infrastructure to support them. Soi 112 is becoming \"New Town\" Hua Hin and is aided by a new road linking the south side of town to the bypass connecting Bangkok to the south of Thailand. You will never visit Hua Hin once as it's magic and charm will always bring you back again.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":3,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","_html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"Hua
