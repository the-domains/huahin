<p>The Bridge Over The River Kwai, in Kanchanaburi is an excellent option for a day trip from Hua Hin. Kanchanaburi is 211 km from Hua Hin and takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to drive there. The Bridge over the River Kwai is one of Thailand's most popular tourist attractions. The bridge was a strategic supply route during World War II, to get supplies from Thailand to Burma on what has been called "Death Railway". An estimated 80,000 people were killed during the construction of the railway. About 20 minutes further down the track is "hellfire pass" which has now been turned into a memorial walk with a museum. The Kanchanaburi War Cemetery is another area to visit and has many visitors throughout the year, especially on ANZAC day. If you want to extend your stay overnight in a guesthouse in Kanchanaburi, there is a chilled out bar scene near the riverside and you can visit of the area's magnificent waterfalls the following day, before returning to Hua Hin.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Bridge Over The River Kwai Kanchanaburi</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
